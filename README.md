## Inspiration

<b>Roxrite</b>
[Video](https://youtu.be/4CofNyGY_AY?t=150)

Roxrite is considered one of the greats in breaking. His video inspired me to create this break training app idea
so that you could train on your own in a very easy and accessible way.

<b>Vincanity</b>

I've been following Vince since I started breakdancing in 2010.
He really shows his love for hip hop and he has helped me grow as a dancer.
His youtube channel has videos for all elements in breaking. 
Thank you Vince for inspiring new breakers and for spreading knowledge for the breaker community.
